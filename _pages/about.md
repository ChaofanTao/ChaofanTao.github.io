# Biography
Hi, I am Chaofan Tao (陶超凡). I am a first-year PhD student in the EEE department, [Univerisity of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://www.hku.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Ngai Wong](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~nwong/) and [Prof. Ping Luo](http://luoping.me/). 

My general research interest is __hardware-efficient machine learning__, including network compression and hardware acceleration. I hope that the ML model could be efficiently deployed on edge devices.

I received my B.S. in the [Yingcai Honors College](http://www.yingcai.uestc.edu.cn/), [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/). I work closely with [Prof. Lixin Duan](http://lxduan.info/) at that time.
