# Biography
Hi, my name is Chaofan Tao. I am an undergraduate student in the [School of Mathematical Science](http://www.math.uestc.edu.cn/) and [Yingcai Honors College](http://www.yingcai.uestc.edu.cn/) (elite school of  2% students), [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/). UESTC is one of the top universities in China admitted into the nation's ["Project 211" and "Project 985"](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/index.php?m=content&c=index&a=lists&catid=72). 

I am doing research in the field of __transfer learning__ currently, under the supervision of [Prof. Lixin Duan](http://lxduan.info/) at the [Big Data Research Center](http://www.ebigdata.org/). My general research interests are __deep learning__, __transfer learning__ and __computer vision__. I focus on the following aspects: (1) Enable the machine to learn efficiently on the new tasks. (2) Enhance the interpretability of machine from theoretical insight. 3) Learn robust representations from unlabeled data.

# Professional Experience
* Nov. 2018 - Mar. 2019: Student researcher for learning robust features for domain adaptation
  + Proposed a novel method for unsupervised domain adaptation by injecting target categorical knowledge directly into the model in an adversarial fashion.
  + Provided theoretical insights about why the proposed model enables fine-grained domain invariance within each category based on the relations between decision boundaries of classifiers and objective functions.
  + Implemented all the experiments in the proposed method and obtained improved performance against state-of-the-art transfer learning methods.

* Feb. 2018 - Oct. 2018: Student researcher for exploiting mutual relation for visual relationship detection
	+ Intern at [Center for Future Media](http://cfm.uestc.edu.cn/index), under the instruction of [Prof. Yang Yang](http://cfm.uestc.edu.cn/~yangyang/).
	+ Co-proposed an effective algorithm for visual relationship detection by exploiting mutual relation in a siamese network and incorporating semantic information in the model.

 
* Mar. 2018 - Sept. 2018: Team member of a 3-people team in Undergraduates Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition
  + Made contributions to design an anti-lost tracker with wireless communication chips for tracking monitored items.
  + Won a prize of 1500 RMB (top 15%).
  
* Sept. 2017 - Jan. 2018: Multi-Clue based Representation Learning for Doctors Clustering
  + Proposed a method to mitigate the problem of data sparsity for doctors clustering by utilizing various types of clue (e.g. rating number and comment text).
  + Crawled various types of data and built an auto-encoder for discriminative representation learning.

* Feb. 2018 - Jan. 2018:Assessment of Undergraduates’ Stress Level Based on Multi-Contributors Mining [PDF](https://github.com/ChaofanTao/ChaofanTao.github.io/blob/master/files/Assessment%20of%20Undergraduates%E2%80%99%20Stress%20Level%20Based%20on%20Multi-Contributors%20Mining.pdf)  
  + Evaluate the level of mental stress in undergraduates and analyse factors that contribute to it by principal component analysis and entropy weight method.
  
* July. 2017 - Sept. 2017 Intern at Center for Future Media, UESTC
  + Under the instruction of Prof. Yang Yang.
  + Finished Stanford Unsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning (Stanford-UFLDL) tutorial. [Code](https://github.com/ChaofanTao/MachineLearning-UFLDL)
  
* Nov. 2017 - Feb. 2018 Mathematical Contest In Modeling/Interdisciplinary Contest In Modeling (MCM/ICM)              
Awarded “Honorable Mention” 
	+ Project 1: Evaluation on Climate-based Fragile State Index  [Project](https://github.com/ChaofanTao/MCM/tree/master/2018-COMAP)
