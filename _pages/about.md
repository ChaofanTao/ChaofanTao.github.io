__I am looking for my PhD position. If youâ€™re interested at self-motivated students, I am always an option!__


# Biography
Hi, my name is Chaofan Tao. I am an undergraduate student in the [School of Mathematical Science](http://www.math.uestc.edu.cn/) and [Yingcai Honors College](http://www.yingcai.uestc.edu.cn/) (elite school of top 2% students), [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/). UESTC is one of the top universities in China admitted into the nation's ["Project 211" and "Project 985"](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/index.php?m=content&c=index&a=lists&catid=72). 

I am doing research in the field of __transfer learning__ currently, under the supervision of [Prof. Lixin Duan](http://lxduan.info/) at the [Data Intelligence group](https://dig.uestc.cn/). My general research interests are __deep learning__, __transfer learning__ and __computer vision__. I focus on the following aspects:  
(1) Enable the machine to learn fast and efficiently on the new tasks.  
(2) Learn robust representations from unlabeled data.  
(3) Learn how to learn.

# Professional Experience
* Nov. 2018 - Mar. 2019: Student researcher for learning robust features for domain adaptation
  + Proposed a novel method for unsupervised domain adaptation by injecting target categorical knowledge directly into the model in an adversarial fashion.
  + Provided theoretical insights about why the proposed model enables fine-grained domain invariance within each category based on the relations between decision boundaries of classifiers and objective functions.
  + Implemented all the experiments in the proposed method and obtained improved performance against state-of-the-art transfer learning methods.

* Feb. 2018 - Oct. 2018: Student researcher for exploiting mutual relation for visual relationship detection
	+ Co-proposed an intuitive algorithm for visual relationship detection by exploiting mutual relation in a siamese network  and incorporating semantic information in the model .
	+ Formulated training methods and conducted part of experiments.
	+ Visualized our comparable results and writed part of the paper.
 
* Mar. 2018 - Sept. 2018: Team member of a 3-people team in Undergraduates Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition
  + Made contributions to design an anti-lost tracker with wireless communication chips for tracking monitored items.
  + Won a prize of 1500 RMB (top 15%).
  
* Sept. 2017 - Jan. 2018: Multi-Clue based Representation Learning for Doctors Clustering
  + Proposed a method to mitigate the problem of data sparsity for doctors clustering by utilizing various types of clue (e.g. rating number and comment text).
  + Crawled various types of data and built an auto-encoder for discriminative representation learning.

* July. 2017 - Sept. 2017 Intern at Center for Future Media, UESTC
  + Under the instruction of Prof. Yang Yang.
  + Finished Stanford Unsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning (Stanford-UFLDL) tutorial. [Code](https://github.com/ChaofanTao/MachineLearning-UFLDL)
  
* Some Curriculum Designs
  + Course Algorithm Desgin and Analysis and ACM-ICPC contests holden by UESTC. [Code](https://github.com/ChaofanTao/AlgorithmDesign)

* Recommendation Letter of Management Innovation Programme, National University of Singapore, Year 2018   
* Outstanding Student Scholarship, Year 2017  
* Prize for finishing National University Student Marathon League, Year 2017  
* 2nd Prize in the Undergraduate Physics Knowledge Competition in Sichuan Province, Year 2017
