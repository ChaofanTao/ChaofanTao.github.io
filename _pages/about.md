My research interests are: <br>

1. `Model/Data-Efficiency & Acceleration:` Pruning, quantization, distillation .etc to reduce model size and speedup inference, or efficient tuning with a small training cost. <br>
2. `Multi-modal Pre-trained Models:` Multi-task large models, which supports diverse tasks with different modalities.<br>
