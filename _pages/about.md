# Short Biography

I am Chaofan Tao (陶超凡), currently a research scientist at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab, Hong Kong. I received my PhD degree in The Univerisity of Hong Kong (HKU), supervised by [Prof. Ngai Wong](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~nwong/) and [Prof. Ping Luo](http://luoping.me/) as a member in [MMLAB@HKU](https://mmlab.hk/). I received my Bachelor degree from the Yingcai Honors College in the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. Previously, I worked at Sea AI Lab (Singapore), Amazon Web Service (Bellevue), Huawei (Shenzhen) and SenseTime (Shanghai) as research intern. 

My general research interests are: <br>
1. `Multi-modal  Models:` Multi-task large models, which supports diverse tasks with different modalities flexibly.<br>
2. `Efficient ML:` Design algorithms (Pruning, quantization, distillation, token reduction .etc) to speedup inference, or efficient tuning with a small training cost. <br>

You can check my [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=list_works&gmla=AJsN-F5DfisY6qynQkPPreVmBlpCYV8WALf-n4aVHphvfHF9GAmm2cYErmRxuXccCwkrSglgJN4L6s2t4Cn5Ei6r5jEfLOvnoA&user=gjmfLroAAAAJ) for more details. My research papers are published in ACL/EMNLP/ECCV/NeurIPS/ICML/T-NNLS, .etc, with ACL  Outstanding Paper Award in 2022.
