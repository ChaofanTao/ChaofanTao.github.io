# Short Biography

I am Chaofan Tao (陶超凡), a PhD candidate in The Univerisity of Hong Kong (HKU), supervised by [Prof. Ngai Wong](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~nwong/) and [Prof. Ping Luo](http://luoping.me/). My research papers are published in ACL/EMNLP/ECCV/T-NNLS/CIKM, .etc.

My research interests are: <br>

1. `Model/Data-Efficiency & Acceleration:` Pruning, quantization, distillation .etc to reduce model size and speedup inference, or efficient tuning with a small training cost. <br>
2. `Pre-trained Language Models:` Multi-task multi-modal large models, which supports diverse tasks with different modalities.<br>
