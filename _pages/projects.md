* Nov. 2018 - Mar. 2019: Student researcher for learning robust features for domain adaptation
  + Proposed a novel method for unsupervised domain adaptation by injecting target categorical knowledge directly into the model in an adversarial fashion.
  + Provided theoretical insights about why the proposed model enables fine-grained domain invariance within each category based on the relations between decision boundaries of classifiers and objective functions.
  + Implemented all the experiments in the proposed method and obtained improved performance against state-of-the-art transfer learning methods.

* Feb. 2018 - Oct. 2018: Student researcher for exploiting mutual relation for visual relationship detection
	+ Intern at [Center for Future Media](http://cfm.uestc.edu.cn/index), under the instruction of [Prof. Yang Yang](http://cfm.uestc.edu.cn/~yangyang/).
	+ Co-proposed an effective algorithm for visual relationship detection by exploiting mutual relation in a siamese network and incorporating semantic information in the model.

 
* Mar. 2018 - Sept. 2018: Team member of a 3-people team in Undergraduates Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition
  + Made contributions to design an anti-lost tracker with wireless communication chips for tracking monitored items.
  + Won a prize of 1500 RMB (top 15%).
  
* Sept. 2017 - Jan. 2018: Multi-Clue based Representation Learning for Doctors Clustering
  + Proposed a method to mitigate the problem of data sparsity for doctors clustering by utilizing various types of clue (e.g. rating number and comment text).
  + Crawled various types of data and built an auto-encoder for discriminative representation learning.

* Feb. 2018 - Jan. 2018:Assessment of Undergraduates’ Stress Level Based on Multi-Contributors Mining [PDF](https://github.com/ChaofanTao/ChaofanTao.github.io/blob/master/files/Assessment%20of%20Undergraduates%E2%80%99%20Stress%20Level%20Based%20on%20Multi-Contributors%20Mining.pdf)  
  + Evaluate the level of mental stress in undergraduates and analyse factors that contribute to it by principal component analysis and entropy weight method.
  
* July. 2017 - Sept. 2017 Intern at Center for Future Media, UESTC
  + Under the instruction of Prof. Yang Yang.
  + Finished Stanford Unsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning (Stanford-UFLDL) tutorial. [Code](https://github.com/ChaofanTao/MachineLearning-UFLDL)
  
* Nov. 2017 - Feb. 2018 Mathematical Contest In Modeling/Interdisciplinary Contest In Modeling (MCM/ICM)

*  Apr. 2018 - Jun. 2018 Fire Alarm Circuit Based on Temperature with Tunable Sensitivity (_Chinese_) [PDF](https://github.com/ChaofanTao/ChaofanTao.github.io/blob/master/files/%E5%A3%B0%E5%85%89%E7%81%AB%E7%81%BE%E6%8A%A5%E8%AD%A6%E7%94%B5%E8%B7%AF%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1%E6%8A%A5%E5%91%8A-%E9%99%B6%E8%B6%85%E5%87%A1.pdf)
	+ Designed a circuit that keeps silent and provide no visual or acoustic signal in normal temperature. Once the temperature reachs an abnormal value, the circuit rings the buzzer and light the LED.  
	+ The sensitivity or the temperature threshold can be easily tuned by adjusting the variable resistor.

* Some Curriculum Designs
  + Course Algorithm Desgin and Analysis and ACM-ICPC contests holden by UESTC. [Code](https://github.com/ChaofanTao/AlgorithmDesign)
